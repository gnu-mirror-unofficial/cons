Cons 2.0.2
**********

- Add RPM and Debian packages for easier installation.

Cons 2.0.1
**********

- Fix a QuickScan regression:  CODREFs that return arrays broke
  because the calling context changed from array to scalar.  Keep it
  in array context and use grep to weed out null entries.

- The map{} function SplitPath returned was using @_, not $_, so it
  would return multiple copies of the whole list, thereby only
  working for a single argument.

- Fix the cons.bat file copyright comments. (pointed out by
  Juan Altmayer Pizzorno <juan@port25.com>)

- Add CXX* default rules for win32. (pointed out by
  Juan Altmayer Pizzorno <juan@port25.com>)

- Documentation fix in "Adding new methods" section. (pointed out
  by Juan Altmayer Pizzorno <juan@port25.com>)

Cons 2.0
********

- Release Version of 1.8b2 (see 1.8b2 for all the changes)

- Redo the copyright to be GNU General Public License.

- Integrate the tests from the cons-test suite into the cons release,
  creating separate tar files with and without the tests.

Cons 1.8b2
**********
Contributions from Wayne Scott <wscott@ichips.intel.com>

- Create subdirectories in the Cache directory if they don't already exist.

- Don't match #include delimiters in comments on the same line.

- Prevent scan::quickscan::scan from adding null entries to its
  include-file list.

Contributions from Damien Neill <neild@segasoft.com>

- An initial '@' on a command line suppresses its printing (a la make).

- Make Cons realize that topdir is part of the file system, allowing
  building/installing in directories more than one level up.

- Add support for rewriting portions of the command line enclosed by
  %[-%] by passing them to a named code ref in the Cons environment.

- Add a -t flag to walk up the directory hierarchy looking for a
  Construct file, allowing invocation from child directories.
  (Contributed with Greg Spencer.)

Contributions from Brad Garcia <bgarcia@home.com>

- Make the default environment '%LINK => '%CXX', which in turn
  transparently maps to '%CC' for anyone not using C++.

Contributions from Greg Spencer <greg_spencer@acm.org>

- Add support for %:b, %:s, %:F and %:a suffixes on pseudo-variables.

- Add Win32 default environment overrides for Microsoft VC++ 6.0.

- Add a -t flag to walk up the directory hierarchy looking for a
  Construct file, allowing invocation from child directories.
  (Contributed with Damien Neill.)   Add hooks to builds an associated
  Linked subdirectory if -t is invoked from a source subdirectory.

- Fix futil::install (and the other futil methods) so they warn,
  not die, and return failure on error.

- Add a Precious method to suppress unlinking a file before building.

Contributions from Eric Shienbrood <ers@wildfire.com>

- Fix the Objects method to return path names relative to the Conscript
  file.

Contributions from Johan Holmberg <holmberg@iar.se>

- Bug fixes in new File::Spec logic for incorrect use of Boolean tests
  instead of string comparisons against ''.

- Performance optimizations:  fix caching values in dir::is_linked
  and futil::mkdir methods.

- CPPPATH as an array ref wasn't properly expanding %-variables,
  causing missed dependencies.

Contributions from Gary Oberbrunner <garyo@genarts.com>

- Have -d print the dependencies in-line with build.  Identify
  what's a Target and what's a dependency we're Checking.

Contributions from Steven Knight <knight@baldmt.com>

- Rewrite all path name manipulation using File::Spec so we're as
  portable as possible (at least between UNIX and NT).  Add support
  for multiple file system volumes through a hash of $root nodes.

- Due to incompatibility problems with some versions of File::Spec
  on some versions of Perl, create our own internal File::Spec class with
  methods cut-and-pasted from the real module, so people don't have to
  install an external File::Spec.

- Rewrite "options" routine; now hash-driven for speed and readability.

- Let Default be called more than once.  Document it.

- Rewrite the dir::lookup and dir::lookupdir methods to avoid changing
  a file node into a dir node if the names match.  This was causing "Can't
  locate object method" errors.  We now enforce a distinction between the
  two node types, so add a dir::lookupfile and dir::lookupdir methods and
  change calls as appropriate.  If someone tries to use a dir as a file
  or vice versa, die and report the error with info about what's wrong,
  where we detected the conflict, and where the node was created.  If a
  dir was created as a file via "FilePath," change it to a dir (preserve
  old behavior), but warn them that they should use "DirPath" instead.
  Add an empty 'entry' subclass for nodes which we don't yet know are
  files or directories.
  (Bug reported by Eric Shienbrood.)

- Have srcsig return a '' signature, not die, if the file can't be read.

- Fix a bunch of perl -w warnings.  There are still a few warnings left.

- Replace the hard-coded global FLAG_CHARACTER and LIB_FLAG_PREFIX
  values with INCDIRPREFIX and LIBDIRPREFIX values in the Cons
  environment, so people can simultaneously use multiple compilers/
  linkers with different calling conventions.
  (Bug reported by Johan Holmberg.)

- Documentation cleanup and updates.

- Minor changes to make sure Cons still executes under Perl 5.003.
  Expand the testing to include Cons under Perl versions 5.00[345]
  as well as 5.6.0.

Cons 1.7
********
Contributions from Rajesh Vaidheeswarran <rv@fore.com>

- Add QuickScan documentation.

- Add Argument passing from cons to Construct.

- Remove modification history feature from cons due to duplication, and
  bloat.

Contributions from Brad Garcia <bgarcia@fore.com>

- Add ability to compile both C and C++ files using the same environment.
  Based off of code written by Michael Polis <mfp@terrasim.com>.

Cons 1.6b1
**********
Contributions from Rajesh Vaidheeswarran <rv@fore.com>

- Fix futil::copy to return undef if unable to copy a target to the cache
  instead of aborting the build process.

Cons 1.6a3
**********
Contributions from <v-ronaar@Exchange.Microsoft.com>

- Fix for Win32: [problem: 'require'ing Win32 won't work when Win32 module
  isn't installed, as is the case for a generic perl installation (not
  ActiveState)].

Contributions from Rajesh Vaidheeswarran <rv@fore.com>

- InstallAs modified to accept either a single file or a list of files as
  source and target.

Cons 1.6a2
**********
Contributions from Rajesh Vaidheeswarran <rv@fore.com>

- Bugfix for Repository to add the path to INC to enable perl packages in
  the local tree to be used in Cons scripts.

- Bugfix for SourcePath to return the correct path in a repositorey enabled
  build.

- Add InstallAs method to link/copy a source file to any arbitrary target
  file name.

- Move all the documentation to cons itself, and get rid of the pod file
  from the distribution. Users can now use perlpod on cons to see the docs.

Cons 1.6a1
**********
Contributions from Steven Knight <knight@baldmt.com>

- Fixed a bug where .consign seems to be closed improperly when
  cons is terminated with a signal, leading to rebuilds of various
  targets that had already been built.

Contributions from Rajesh Vaidheeswarran <rv@fore.com>

- New flag -q (for quiet) to be less verbose about what files were
  `Install'ed (or `Removed' when used in conjunction with -r).

Cons 1.5
********
Contributions from Steven Knight <knight@baldmt.com>

- Added Repository global function, similar to make's VPATH, and
  supporting functions:  Local, Install_Local, Repository_List,
  Repository_Sig_Times_OK.

- Added -R command-line option as a synonym for Repository.

- Bugfix for SplitPath (when given a path with N components,
  it returned N**2 components).

Cons 1.4a3
**********
Contributions from Rajesh Vaidheeswarran <rv@fore.com>

- Construction local help.
  Exported command: Help <string>;

Cons 1.4a2
**********
Contributions from Bob Sidebotham:

- LIBPATH, CPPPATH, and program search path ENV->{PATH} may all now
  be arrays. The old usage (colon separated strings) is deprecated, but
  still supported. In the old form, on Unix, ":"'s separate path components,
  and on Windows, ";" separates them.

- PATH_SEPERATOR was finally changed to PATH_SEPARATOR

Contributions from Steven Knight <knight@baldmt.com>

- Default target support has been added (see RELEASE for details).

Cons 1.4 (alpha1)
*****************

This release of Cons has a number of changes. Briefly, they are:

 - a QuickScan function that makes it trivial to set up
   simple dependency scanners by Bob Sidebotham.

 - improvements in signature calculation for better control of rebuilds

 - a caching mechanism for sharing derived files between builds

 - new global functions: UseCache, Salt, SourcePath, ConsPath.

 - some minor cleanup

Cons 1.3.1
**********

This is a minor release with limited shared library support contributed by
Gary Oberbrunner <garyo@genarts.com>.

Documentation is now maintained in pod format, thanks to the cons.pod file
from Ulrich Pfiefer.

Cons 1.3
********

This is the first combined Win32 and unix cons contributed by Rajesh
Vaidheeswarran <rv@fore.com>. This contains some significant fixes that
enables the same cons file to be used for both platforms.

Cons 1.2
********

This is the WIN32 port of cons by Chriss Stephens <chriss@fore.com>, Rajesh
Vaidheeswarran <rv@fore.com> and Jochen Schwarze <schwarze@isa.de>.

Cons 1.1
********

This is a minor patch release to cons 1.0. This contains a number of
minor changes, a bug fix affecting multi-target commands, and a couple
of minor new features. A list of changes from 1.0 to 1.1 is included
in the file CHANGES. There are no incompatible changes between 1.0 and
1.1. The NT support is working well here, but it still hasn't been
integrated into an single version of cons. The changes are quite
simple, and if anyone wants it let me know.

Cons 1.0
********

This is a Perl5-based make replacement, but does not provide make
compatibility.

You will need Perl 5.002 or better and the Perl MD5 Extension
(MD5-1.6.tar.gz), available from CPAN.

This program is known to work on a variety of platforms: it's in
production use on versions of SunOS, Solaris, HPUX, AIX, and IRIX.

The current program will not work correctly on Windows/NT, but we do
have an internal version that does appear to work on that platform,
but has not been well tested. If anyone is interested, contact me.

PostScript documentation is in cons.ps.

The following is an excerpt from the introduction in cons.ps:

 Cons is a system for constructing, primarily, software, but is quite
 different from previous software construction systems. Cons was
 designed from the ground up to deal easily with the construction of
 software spread over multiple source directories. Cons makes it easy
 to create build scripts that are simple, understandable and
 maintainable. Cons ensures that complex software is easily and
 accurately reproducible.

 Cons uses a number of techniques to accomplish all of this.
 Construction scripts are just Perl scripts, making them both easy to
 comprehend and very flexible. Global scoping of variables is replaced
 with an import/export mechanism for sharing information between
 scripts, significantly improving the readability and maintainability
 of each script. Construction environments are introduced: these are
 Perl objects that capture the information required for controlling the
 build process. Multiple environments are used when different semantics
 are required for generating products in the build tree. Cons
 implements automatic dependency analysis and uses this to globally
 sequence the entire build. Variant builds are easily produced from a
 single source tree. Intelligent build subsetting is possible, when
 working on localized changes. Overrides can be setup to easily
 override build instructions without modifying any scripts. MD5
 cryptographic signatures are associated with derived files, and are
 used to accurately determine whether a given file needs to be rebuilt.
