Cons 2.2.0
**********

This release is a stable release of Cons.  It contains all the changes
from the 2.1 development branch, including many changes developed on
that branch after the release of 2.1.2.

Visible changes include:

    --	Cons will now use the Digest::MD5 module in preference to the
    	older, deprecated MD5 module.  The MD5 module will be used if
	Digest::MD5 is not installed.

    --	When using the -t option, Cons now prints a message about its
    	internal directory-change to the top-level directory.  This
	allows emacs to be aware of the directory to which path names
	in build output are relative.

    --	The QuickScan method on Windows NT now uses ';' instead of
	':' as the PATH separator.  An array ref may also be used.

    --	The Depends and SourcePath methods can now cope with an
    	array of targets.

This release contains many other fixes and less-visible changes.  See the
CHANGES file for details.
