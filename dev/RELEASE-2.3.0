Cons 2.3.0
**********

Important visible changes include:

- Configurable support for signatures based on file contents has
  been added via a SourceSignature() method and a SIGNATURE
  construction variable.  IMPORTANT:  This changes the format
  of .consign files.  Existing .consign files from prior versions
  of Cons (e.g., in a Repository) will not interoperate with this
  version.

- Multiple single-character command-line flags can now be concatenated.

- Multiple -q options can be used to make the build quieter.

- The calling semantics of the semi-internal _Objects method have
  been changed to take a set of path names, not file references,
  and return the looked-up file references.  This will affect
  any user-defined methods that call the _Objects method.

- A -S option has been used to allow a signature package to be
  specified.  -S md5::debug enables debug messages for Cons
  MD5 dependency calculations.

- A new AfterBuild method can be used to execute Perl code after a
  target has been evaluated.

- The sig::md5::srcsig() method has had its calling sequence changed.
  A $self argument was added to make the method object-oriented,
  allowing for better subclassing of the sig::md5 package.

- A new RuleSet() method fetches a standard set of construction
  variables for a Microsoft Visual C environment or a traditional UNIX
  environment.

- A new DefaultRules() method sets the default construction variables
  returned by the cons::new() method.

- Added experimental support for building targets using Perl code
  references.
