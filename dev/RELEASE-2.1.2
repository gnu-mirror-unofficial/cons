Cons 2.1.2
**********

This release contains a great many small changes for portability and
general clean-up, most of which should not be noticed by most users.

Visible changes include:

    --	A fix for UNC path names (\\share\dir\subdir\file) on Windows NT.

    --	A new Conscript_chdir() method that can be used to enable
	Perl file-globbing in subsidiary Conscript files.

    --	Correct exit-status reporting on Windows NT, including
	identifying failures to find a program in the search path.

    --	There is now a separate cons-tests package that contains
	the regression tests and a productized cons-test script
	for executing them.

    --	The cons and cons-test packages are now available in both
	RPM and Debian formats.

See the CHANGES file for details.
