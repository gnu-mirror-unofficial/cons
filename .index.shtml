<DT><H3>What is CONS?</H3>
<DD>
Do you use Makefiles for your project?  Have you ever done a "make clean;
make all" just because you didn't know if the files you changed would be
rebuilt correctly?  Or perhaps you work on several machines accessing an
NFS server, and if their clocks aren't in sync, make won't know to rebuild
things?  Well, welcome to a new and better way to control the building of
your projects.

<P><DD>

CONS is a replacement for MAKE.  It is not compatible with make, but it has
a number of powerful capabilities not found in other software construction
systems, including make.  It is distributed under the
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/copyleft.html"> GNU General Public
License (GPL).</A>

<P><DD>

CONS is implemented in Perl.  You don't need to know Perl to use CONS,
although you can use it more powerfully if you do.

<P><DD>

CONS is known to work on a variety of platforms.  It's in production use on
versions of FreeBSD, Linux, Solaris, Windows NT, SunOS, HPUX, AIX, and IRIX.

<DT><H3>Where can I get CONS?</H3>

The latest <b>stable version</b> of CONS is <!--#exec cmd='cat stable/VERSION'-->.

<P><DD>

For each version, you can download either the base package that just
contains CONS itself, or a developer package that contains a full set of
portable regression tests.  There is no difference between the copies of
CONS in the two packages.  Most users should only need the base package
without the test suite.  The developer package is recommended for people
who are planning to add new features to CONS and want to make sure they
don't break existing functionality, or who want to verify that CONS
works correctly on their system.

<P><DD>

For verification purposes, MD5 checksums exist for each package.
